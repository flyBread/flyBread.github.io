##### 第一个周末

第一个周末开始的时候，并不顺利，或者说很糟糕，因为自己看了半个小时的MAC App开发中的Objective-C 的东西，突然想到以前写的需要看看redis，然后就在两者之间徘徊。想着自己现在是看redis呢？还是继续看Objective-C，自己又是基于一个什么样的考虑才会选择这一个，这些搞笑的事情。。。。。

中间接了一个电话，又发生了一些郁闷的事情，自己就不在想学习自己的技术了，直接刷起了知乎，还是不能够坚定自己的信念。  

有迷茫看书，想明白了，然后自己就要脚踏实地的干活。自己这个星期看的书籍：
+ 《暗时间》
+ redis

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), **in-memory data structure store**, used as **database**, *cache* and **message broker**.

message borker 消息代理--中间件先关的技术应用。

  It supports data structures such as

  strings, 字符串


  hashes,

  lists,

  sets,

  sorted sets with range queries,

  bitmaps,

  hyperloglogs

  and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

  Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.    


You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string; incrementing the value in a hash; pushing an element to a list; computing set intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest ranking in a sorted set.
In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log. Persistence can be optionally disabled, if you just need a feature-rich, networked, in-memory cache.
Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave asynchronous replication, with very fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection with partial resynchronization on net split.
Other features include:
Transactions
Pub/Sub
Lua scripting
Keys with a limited time-to-live
LRU eviction of keys
Automatic failover
You can use Redis from most programming languages out there.
Redis is written in ANSI C and works in most POSIX systems like Linux, *BSD, OS X without external dependencies. Linux and OS X are the two operating systems where Redis is developed and more tested, and we recommend using Linux for deploying. Redis may work in Solaris-derived systems like SmartOS, but the support is best effort. There is no official support for Windows builds, but Microsoft develops and maintains a Win-64 port of Redis.
